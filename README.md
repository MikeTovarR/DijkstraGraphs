# DijkstraGraphs

_Made by Miguel Tovar and Carlos Velez_

---

A python project that shows the functionality and output of Dijkstra algorithm in a GUI

built in pygame. To run the program the user must have pygame installed.

The user will be able to click the main screen of the app to add path nodes and create paths between

them. At the end the program will show the user the shortest path between the first node and the final node.
